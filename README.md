### Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods

## Part 1 (Week 1)

Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.
This submission will eventually become your Introduction/Business Problem section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Introduction/Business Problem section only for now) to your Github repository and submit a link to it.

## 1) Introduction/Business Problem

Searching for the appropriate location to open a Chinese restaurant in Toronto

It is known that choosing the location of a restaurant is a significant decision and is crucial to the success of a business. It is understandable that not every location is suitable for a restaurant and thus, it is important to consider several factors such as, restaurant cuisine, target customer segment and competitors in the vicinity. Hence, this project aims to help users to identify the most optimal location to select when opening a restaurant. 

A.	Type of Restaurant/Cuisine
The type of restaurant determines the cuisine that will be served and the atmosphere of the place. 
For example, will it be a bar, caf√©, casual dining or fine-dining.

B.	Target customer segment
There are many different factors when deciding on the target segment. In this section, we will look into the income groups, ethnicity and the potential demand based on population size. We should also evaluate the income groups of the population to determine the affordability of the restaurant.

C.	Competitors in the vicinity
When a business is selecting a location to start a restaurant they look into different food districts in each neighborhood to understand the competition in the area. It is crucial to evaluate the number of competitors in the area.



## 2) Data

Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.

The data of the neighborhoods in Toronto will be extracted from:
We will be required to scrap the data from the table from Wikipedia where we will be able to extract the data and obtain the coordinates of Toronto and the neighborhoods by utilizing the geocoder API.

The foursquare location API will be utilized to obtain the details of the venue and specific information about the neighborhoods. This will enable us to parse and process the data to construct a formatted table to display the results containing the information retrieved.
